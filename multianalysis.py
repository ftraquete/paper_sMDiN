# Functions present are for the different kinds of multivariate analysis made in the Jupyter Notebooks.

"""Here are compiled the functions developed for specific applications of multivariate analysis (many use the base function from the
scikit-learn Python package) in metabolomics data analysis workflow. The functions are split in the following sub-sections (designed
for a multivariate analysis method):

- Hierarchical Clustering Analysis: calculating Discrimination Distance (dist_discrim), correct first cluster percentage
(correct_1stcluster_fraction), 'ranks' of the iteration nº two samples were clustered together in linkage matrix (mergerank) and
calculating a correlation (similarity) measure between two dendrograms (Dendrogram_Sim).

- K-means Clustering: perform K-means clustering and store results (Kmeans) support function to select x% of "better" k-means
clustering and calculate Discrimination Distance (global and for each group) and adjusted Rand index (Kmeans_discrim).

- Oversampling functions: simple and incomplete SMOTE (fast_SMOTE) - not in use

- Random Forest: building and evaluating (and storing results) Random Forest models from datasets (simple_RF), another method in disuse
to make and evaluate Random Forest models from a dataset (overfit_RF) and permutation tests of the significance of predictive accuracy
of Random Forest models (permutation_RF).

- PLS-DA: obtaining X_scores from a PLSRegression (PLSscores_with_labels), obtaining the Y response group memberships matrix
(_generate_y_PLSDA), obtaining PLS scores from models built with 1 to n components (optim_PLS), calculating VIP scores for features to
build PLS-DA models (_calculate_vips), building and evaluating (and storing results) PLS-DA models from datasets (model_PLSDA) and
permutation tests of the significance of predictive accuracy of PLS-DA models (permutation_PLSDA).
